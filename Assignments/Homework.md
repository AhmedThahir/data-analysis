# Homework Guidelines

## General

- Each assignment will be graded on a 0 - 4 scale.
    - Truly exceptional assignment may get a 5 and will be posted on the course repo.
- Up to two people are allowed to work on the same assignment. The assignment will have two authors.
- You can write your assignment in either English or Chinese.

## Format
You should compile your assignment to `pdf` or `html` and submit on SPOC. In addition, submit all source files (e.g., latex, markdown or jupyter notebooks) and data associated with the homework.

#### Extra Points
+0.25:
- writing in `LaTeX`
    - see [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/blob/master/Materials/Software/LaTex/LaTex.md)
- writing in `R markdown`
    - see [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Resources/#rr-markdown)
- writing in `Jupyter notebook`
    - see [here](https://jupyter.org/) and [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) for instructions. see [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks#statistics-machine-learning-and-data-science) for examples.
    - here is an entire course written in `jupyter notebooks`: [Computational Statistics and Statistical Computing](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2018/index.html) (also an excellent course you can check out)

+n: completing a challenge satisfactorily (n varies by challenge)
- n = maximum additional points you can get by doing the challenge

*note*: if two people co-author an assignment, **both** need to submit it on SPOC.

## Theoretical Report

Write a short report (1 - 2 pages) on a lecture-related topic.

*Suggestions*: Other than the lecture slides, the "[notes and resources](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Lectures/)" page contains additional readings and materials for each lecture that should be helpful for you in choosing a topic as well as in your writing.

*Important*: you should write as if your target audience is your fellow students, *not* me. In other words, imagine you are writing a tutorial for your fellow students and try to be as clear as possible.

## Empirical Analysis

Demonstrate or apply a statistical/econometric method introduced in or relevant to the lecture. You can:
- Implement a method using simulated data
- Analyze real data

For sources of data, see [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Resources/#miscellaneous). You are also encouraged to use the data you are using in your own research.

You **must** include your code with your report.

Examples: [[1](https://github.com/philippbauch/simple-linear-regression-notebook/blob/master/linear-regression-demo.ipynb)], [[2](https://xiaoluli97.github.io/2019/04/06/DA-A3/)], [[3](https://lzc563236.github.io/2019/04/21/Homework4/)]

## Academic Integrity
- You **must** reference any sources you used in your writing using proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL)
- You **must** acknowledge any sentences or codes that are not written by yourself.
- Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity. If it is found that you used sources without proper reference, you will get a zero for your homework the first time and you will fail the course the second time.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- I do not have any friends. I expect to do all the homework by myself. Are my assignments going to be graded under the same criteria as those that are the results of collaboration? Would that be unfair?
    - Whether an assignment is written by one student or two, will be not be a factor of consideration in initial evaluation. However, at the end of the semester, your homework grades will be adjusted to reflect your proper contribution. This means that if you write your homework alone, your grades will be bumped up at the end of the semester. Conversely, if you work in groups of two, you need to do a better job!
    - Also: get a friend.
