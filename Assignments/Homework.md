# Homework Guidelines

## Evaluation

- Each assignment will be graded on a 0-4 scale.
    - Truly exceptional assignment may get 5.
- Up to two people are allowed to work on the same assignment. The assignment will have two authors.

## Format
You can submit your assignment in two ways:
1. compile your assignment to `pdf` or `html` and submit on Moodle
2. upload your assignment to your personal github repo and provide a link to the file on Moodle.

*note*: if two people co-author an assignment, **both** need to submit it using one of the methods above.

<u>Extra points for</u>:
- writing in `LaTeX` (+0.5)
    - see [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/blob/master/Materials/Software/LaTex/LaTex.md).
- publishing on your own github page (+1.0)
    - see [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/blob/master/Materials/Software/Git%20and%20Github/Git%20and%20Github.md)

## Theoretical Report

Write a short report (1 - 2 pages) on a lecture-related topic.

*Suggestions*: Other than the lecture slides, the "[notes and resources]((https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Lectures/))" page contains additional readings and materials for each lecture that should be helpful for you in choosing a topic as well as in your writing.

*Important*: you should write as if your target audience is your fellow students, *not* me. In other words, try to be as clear and detailed as possible.

## Reference and Academic Integrity
- You **must** reference any sources you used in your writing using proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL)
- You **must** acknowledge any sentences or codes that are not written by yourself.
- Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity. If it is found that you used sources without proper reference, you will get a zero for your homework the first time and you will fail the course the second time.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- I am an undergraduate student and I just learned what "probability" means for the first time last week. Are my assignments going to be graded under the same criteria as those of graduate students? Would that be unfair?
    - Whether an assignment is written by one student or two students, by undergraduate or graduate students, will be not be a factor of consideration in initial evaluation. However, at the end of the semester, your homework grades will be adjusted to reflect your proper academic level and contribution. This means that if you are an undergraduate student or if you write your homework alone, your grades will be bumped up at the end of the semester.


- I do not have any friends. I expect to do all the homework by myself. Are my assignments going to be graded under the same criteria as those that are the results of collaboration? Would that be unfair?
    - See above. Also: get a friend.
