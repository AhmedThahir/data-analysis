# Homework Challenge (2 Extra Points)

1. Summarize the following papers:
    - Athey & Imbens, "Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects" [[link](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Regression%20and%20Matching%20for%20Causal%20Inference)]
    - Wagner & Athey, "Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests" [[link](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Regression%20and%20Matching%20for%20Causal%20Inference)]

2. Implement their methods on both simulated and real data.

    - For implementation, use the `R` package [causalTree](). Also read [this turorial](https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree/blob/master/briefintro.pdf) for an overview of the methods and their implementation.
    - For an example of empirical analysis, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09179).

3. (not necessary but recommended:) Compare the effectiveness of tree-based methods vs. other methods on your simulated data. When do tree-based methods work the best?
