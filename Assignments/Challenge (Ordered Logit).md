# Classification and Discrete Choice Models
# Homework Challenge: Ordered Logit (1 Extra Points)

(Multinomial) Logistic regression is used to model categorical dependent variables whose categories are not ordered. For ordered categorical data, we could use models like **ordered logit**. Examples like ordered categorical data include survey question data (not satisfied, satisfied, highly satisfied), ratings data (one star, two stars, three stars), or ordered discretization of continuous variables (income below $5000, $5000 - $10,000, ...).

1. Write a tutorial on ordered logit. Clearly explain the theory, model, usage and technical details. 
2. Estimate an ordered logit model on a real data set for an empirical application.
