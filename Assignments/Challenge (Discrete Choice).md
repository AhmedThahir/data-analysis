# Homework Challenge (4 Extra Points)

In the random utility framework, we model individual choice as individual i choosing among K choices by maximizing her utility U(i,k), with U(i,k) being a function of observed individual and alternative characteristics x(i,k).

Now imagine you are studying a problem in which several individuals make desions *simulataneously* and each individual's utility depends not only on x(i,k), but also on what other individuals will do.

Example 1: movie release date. When a film studio is deciding on the release date of a movie, it has to consider not only consumer demand (e.g., demand is higher in the summer or around big holidays), but also what its competitors will do (e.g., I want to release my movie in April, but what if Disney drops its Avengers in April as well?). For an analysis of this problem, see [Einav (2010)](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Games).

Example 2: firm entry. When a firm decides whether to enter a particular market, it has to consider not only the characteristics of the market, but also whether its competitors will enter the market too. (e.g., when K-mart decides whether to build a store in a small town, it has to consider whether Walmart will enter in the future as well.) For an analysis of this problem, see [Jia (2008)](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Games).

In these cases, individual choices involve **strategic interactions**, which we can model using **game theory**. Each individual's choice can be considered the result of an **equilibrium strategy**. The resulting model is called a **discrete game** model.

## Challenge

Can you think of a way to model this type of strategic interactions in discrete choice problems?

Challenge: do a simple discrete game model involving several players and estimate their utility parameters from data (feel free to simulate the data yourself).

## Reference

Estimation of games is a type of **structural estimation**, and has been a big topic in *empirical industrial organization*.

While there is a long list of literature, here you can find a simple introduction to the estimation of static games: [Ellickson & Misra (2011)](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Games).
