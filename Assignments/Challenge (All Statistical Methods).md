# Homework Challenge (4 Extra Points)

Read the paper "Machine Learning Methods for Demand Estimation" by Bajari et al.: [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Introduction)

In the paper, Table 1 gives the results of several methods the authors have tried for demand estimation. Random forest and the combined model perform the best.

### Challenge

Download the paper's data [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151021) and use your own method to estimate the data.

*Goal*: find a method that performs better than *any* of the authors' methods.
