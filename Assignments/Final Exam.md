# Final Exam Question Design

#### Rules for Design

- You can submit at most 3 questions for the final exam
- Each question should either be (a) a multiple choice problem; or (b) a short answer problem
- Questions should be related to our lecture materials
- A student should be reasonably expected to be able to finish a question in 10 minutes (i.e. not too hard or time-consuming)
- Your question will be selected for use in the final exam based on (a) difficulty; (b) ingenuity; (c) relevance; and (d) fun

#### Submission DDL

- Submit your question to one of the TAs by email before **June 11, 2021**

#### Reward

- For each adopted question, you will get a reward of 4 points on your overall non-exam score[^1].

[^1]: Your final course grade = final exam * 0.15 + midterm * 0.15 + overall non-exam score * 0.7, where overall non-exam score = (homework score * 0.5 + final project * 0.2)/0.7. Note that every individual score item is on a 100 point basis.
