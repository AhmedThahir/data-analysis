- The goal is to equip you with both a solid theoretical foundation, and the tools to conduct empirical research using state-of-the-art technology.

- Lecture materials are written to be both deep conceptually and easy to follow technically.

- Methods are demonstrated with applications to actual and simulated problems in applied economics.

---

# This Course 

- There are no textbooks. We will rely on lecture notes.

- The course repo contains additional materials, notes, and resources for each lecture. 

- This course is fast paced and covers a lot of ground. 

    - It is *highly* recommended that you preview the lecture materials before each class and review them afterwards.
    
    - It is *also* recommended that you form study groups to discuss the materials and work together to understand them.

---

# This Course 

- Weekly review sessions will go over course materials, as well as programming and data analysis problems.

    - Consider them partly as lab sessions!
    
- Due to time constraint, many topics discussed in the lecture notes will not be covered in detail in class.

    - You are encouraged to read them by yourself or in study groups.
    
    - If you have any questions, ask on Piazza!
    
> How much you learn depends on how much time you spend.

---

# Computing

- You are expected to have some familiarity with *at least one* programming/statistical computing languages (`R`, `Python`, `Matlab`, `Stata`, etc.). 

- Lectures are written in `R`. 

- For homework and final project, you can choose *any* language you want.

# Homework

- Homework assignments are submitted on [Moodle](http://l.xmu.edu.cn).

- One homework for each lecture:

    - Writing a report on a lecture-related topic
    
    - Empirical applications of statistical and econometric methods
    
    - Completing "homework challenges" for extra credits
    
- You are encouraged to discuss and collaborate with classmates. Up to 2 individuals are allowed to work together on a single homework.

---

# Communications

- We will be using [Piazza]( https://piazza.com/xmu.edu.cn/fall2019/microeconometrics) for course related discussions.

- If you any questions about course materials, the best way to get answers is to ask them on Piazza.

    - Other students invariably have the same questions as you do and everyone can benefit from the discussions.
    
    - You can edit questions and answers wiki-style.
    
    - You can be anonymous if you wish.
    
    - You can also send private notes to the teaching staff.
    
- Active participation on Piazza will be considered towards the final grade.
