# Homework

- Homework assignments are submitted on [Moodle](http://l.xmu.edu.cn).

- One homework for each lecture:

    - Writing a report on a lecture-related topic
    
    - Empirical application of methods
    
    - Coding examples into other languages
    
- You are encouraged to discuss and collaborate with classmates. Up to 2 people are allowed to work together on a single homework (collaborators submit 1 homework only).

---

# Computing

- You are expected to have some familiarity with *at least one* programming/statistical computing language. 

- Lectures are written in `R`, but examples in `Python` and `Stata` are also provided. 

- For your homework and final project, you can choose *any* language you want.

---

# How this course is taught

- No textbooks. We will rely on lecture notes.

- The lecture materials are written to be both deep conceptually and easy to follow technically.

- This course is fast paced and covers a lot of ground. 

    - It is *highly recommended* that you preview the lecture materials before each class and review them afterwards.
    
    - It is *also recommended* that you form study groups to discuss the materials and work together to understand them.

---

# How this course is taught

- Weekly review sessions will go over course materials, as well as programming and data analysis problems.

    - Consider them partly as lab sessions!
    
- Due to time constraint, many topics in lecture notes will not be covered in detail in class.

    - You are encouraged to read them by yourself or in study groups.
    
    - If you have any questions, ask them on Piazza!
    
    
> How much you learn depends on how much time you spend.

# Communications

- We will be using [Piazza]( https://piazza.com/xmu.edu.cn/spring2019/001/home) for course related discussions.

- If you any questions about course materials, the best way to get answers is to ask them on Piazza.

    - Other students invariably have the same questions as you do and everyone can benefit from the discussions.
    
    - You can edit questions and answers wiki-style.
    
    - You can be anonymous if you wish.
    
    - You can also send private notes to the teaching staff.
    
    - [Demo](https://piazza.com/class/gw9jakygzvs616)
    
- Active participation on Piazza (both posting and answering questions) earns up to 5% extra credit.
